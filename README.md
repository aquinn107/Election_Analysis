# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections is looking for the election audit of a recent local congressional election to determine the winner by popular vote.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Summary
The analysis of the election data shows that:
- There were 369,711 total votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 total number of votes.
    - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 total number of votes.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 total number of votes.
- The winner of the election was:
    - Diana DeGette with 73.8% of the votes and 272,892 total votes. 

## Challenge Summary
In summary, this code can easily be modified in minor ways that could help track votes across all forms of government. Based on a few changes with the data structure, we can track and audit additional candidate elections throughout various locations, including across state lines. Secondly, we can modify this code to help broaden its capabilities should there be any ballot questions that governments require to be audited as well.
